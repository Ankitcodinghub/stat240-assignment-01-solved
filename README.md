Problem 1: Random variables review

A random variable X is a real number with a value that depends on a

random event. For example, X may be the measurement from a sensor, or

the outcome of a die roll, or a property of an item chosen at random from

a population of items. The probability that a random variable X is less

than or equal to a real number x is denoted PrpX ď xq. The function that

maps x to PrpX ď xq is known as the cumulative distribution function (cdf)

of X (this function may be denoted fX). The cdf has many properties,

for example lim PrpX ď xq “ 1. In some situations, and under some xÑ8

assumptions, random variables often have a cdf that is of a particularly well studied form. These forms are called laws, and we may say for example ‘X is distributed according to the law Exppλq’ or ‘X „ Exppλq’ to specify that a random variable is exponentially distributed with rate λ ą 0.

Given the cdf of a random variable, we may ask how the value of the random variable concentrates around a particular real number x. The ex- pression PrpX ą x and X ď x ` dxq gives the probability that X lies in the interval px, x ` dxs. By the laws of probability, this expression is equal to fXpx ` dxq ́ fXpxq. By taking the limit as dx goes to zero, and scaling by 1{dx, we find the concentration of probability around x:

lim pfX px ` dxq ́ fX pxqq{dx “ d fX pxq. This derivative (if it exists) is dxÑ0 dx

known as the probability density function (pdf) of the random variable X.

a) Suppose X is a random variable with pdf proportional to e ́λx if x is positive and 0 otherwise. What is the pdf of X? (i.e., what is the constant of proportionality?) What is the cdf of X?

(4 points) b) Suppose X is a random variable with pdf p. The mean of X is:

Problem 3: Using knitr

There are several ways to interleave R code and the output of R code (including plots) into a pdf. The R package knitr is one such way, and you may find it useful for creating reports and doing subsequent assign- ments. The way knitr works is by using a style of coding and creating documents called ‘markdown’. In RStudio, install knitr using the command install.packages(’knitr’). Then, create a new R markdown docu- ment by selecting ‘File — New File — R Markdown’ from the menus. You’ll be prompted to give a name to the new R markdown file and select if you want it to output to pdf or html. Choose pdf. The basic format of an R markdown file is as follows (and your document may be populated with an example text such as this):

<pre>---
title: "Untitled"
output: pdf_document
---
</pre>
<pre>‘‘‘{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
‘‘‘
</pre>
## R Markdown

<pre>This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple
   formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS
   Word documents. For more details on using R
   Markdown see &lt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&gt;.
</pre>
<pre>When you click the **Knit** button a document will be
   generated that includes both content as well as the
</pre>
<pre>    output of any embedded R code chunks within the
   document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<pre>‘‘‘{r cars}

‘‘‘
## Including Plots
</pre>
<pre>You can also embed plots, for example:
</pre>
<pre>‘‘‘{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
‘‘‘
</pre>
Click the ‘knit’ on the toolbar of RStudio’s editor to render the mark- down as a pdf. The document should pop up in a preview window. The pdf will also be saved in the same directory that your new R markdown file is saved in. The element ‘##’ specifies a section title, the element ‘title: “Untitled”’specifiesthedocumenttitle,theelements‘‘‘‘{r …} … ‘‘‘’ specify R code that is to be executed. The element echo=FALSE in- dicates that the R code should not be emitted in the file (and instead, only the results of the code should be emitted). Markdown allows you to spec- ify bolding, hyperlinks, bullets and other text aspects through annotations such as **Knit** for a bold ‘Knit’ (the asterisks indicate the bolding). An overview of the options for formatting and running code in R markdown is available here: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/ 2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf.

a) The University of California at Irvine provides a repository of datasets that are popular for demonstrations of machine learning and statistical methodology. Choose one of their datasets from this site: https:// archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php, and download it. The downloads usually include two files: one ending in .data which can be loaded by R using the command read.table and one ending in .names containing a detailed description of the dataset.

In an R markdown, provide a short summary of the dataset What 5 of 6

is the dataset about? When was it collected? How many items are in the dataset? How many variables are provided? Broadly, what types of variables are there, and broadly, what are their units? (For example, if there are thousands of variables all with the same units indicating measurements at different times, you can just say what the measurement is, what the units are and what the times are: you don’t have to list each individual variable.) This summary should be no more than half a page.

Choose one of the variables and plot a histogram of that variable. Ensure that the x-axis is labelled correctly, with units. Make the his- togram so that its y-axis is ‘proportion’ and not ‘count’ (i.e., the sum of the areas of the histogram rectangles should equal 1). Superimpose on top of the histogram a plot of the pdf of a normal distribution (a.k.a. Gaussian distribution, or bell-curve) with mean and variance given by the empirical mean and variance of the variable. (For example, if you’ve chosen the 5th variable of the dataset and the dataset is loaded into R as the variable df, then the empirical mean is mean(df[, 5]) and the empirical variance is var(df[, 5]).) Provide a single pdf including the rendered R markdown followed by a listing of the text of the R markdown file.
